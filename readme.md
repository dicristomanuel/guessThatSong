Simple, stylish itunes music guessing game with some of my favorite tracks.

*This is one of the first project I've created at Galvanize EDU after learning to make api calls*

The app uses the awesome and intuitive iTunes API to get artist and track info together with the audio preview. Unfortunately iTunes doesn't return good quality album pictures so in order to display them I used the audioscrobbler API.

#### ENJOY!
