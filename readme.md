This is a fun and entertaining memory game where the user is required to find the pair of cards that
matches together. No mistakes are allowed, everytime you won't find the right match the game will have to start all over  

*This is one of the first project I've created at Galvanize EDU after learning to manipulate the DOM with* **Vanilla Javascript** *(no jQuery involved)*

To implement:

- new levels where the grid becomes smaller and smaller
- live game with a second player
- mobile version where the user will be shown every single card and will have to repeat the exact order

#### ENJOY!
